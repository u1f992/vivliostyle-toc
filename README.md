[unified](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) plugin that integrates automatic tables of contents generation into [Vivliostyle CLI](https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle-cli) workflows.

Vivliostyle CLI already [supports automatically generating a table of contents](https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle-cli/pull/485), but it has limitations: it does not allow specifying the position where the table of contents is inserted, adding preceding or following content, or excluding certain headings from being collected. Therefore, it is not well suited for producing complete books.
